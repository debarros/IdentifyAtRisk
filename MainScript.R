#Generate risk scores for students
#This is limited to students who are failing at least 3 classes, and who are not in 12th grade

#A student's risk score is calculated as the sum of the risk scores for his individual classes
# Passing - 0 risk pts
# Failing by <10 pts - 1 risk pt
# Failing by 10-20 pts - 2 risk pts
# Failing by >20 pts - 3 risk pts

#The grades on which the student's risk scores are based are estimated using Q1, Q2, and E1 stored grades and Q3 current grades
#The stored grades table should be exported (from DDE in PowerSchool) for the current year and put in the Stored tab of the 'at risk grade data.xlsx' file
#To fill in the Current tab of the 'at risk grade data.xlsx' file, export the csv from the Percent Grades Report (under custom reports in PowerSchool)

#Estimate course grades
